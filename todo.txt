Yelp categories--how to get all the categories either by query or storing
Work on the UI (cries)


**Yelp's API doesn't include the price (cries)
	Solution: Pick a restaurant, and make a get request to its page
	Parse the HTML, looking for something like
		<span class="business-attribute price-range" itemprop="priceRange">$$</span>
	Get the price, and choose the restaurant if the price falls under conditions.
	Continue 3 times
	
Yelp is limited to return 20 restaurants.
-Make calls until >50 or done
